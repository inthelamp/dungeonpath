# Dungeon Path
Platform game developing with Godot Engine and C# 

Godot v3.3 is applied.

C# is one of multipurpose high level languages. Godot engine is an open source game engine for creating 2D and 3D games and developed based on object-oriented design. It provides C# API to nicely organize its user-friendly features in creating your awesome world.

GDScript API is the primary language that Godot engine supports and there are a lot of examples and tutorials using GDScript available on the Internet, while C# API has been introduced since Godot engine v3.0 and still has some features not fully implemented yet. However, if you are familiar with C#, it is not difficult to use Godot engine with C# API and no GDScript is needed for your project.

DungeonPath is a platform game for showing how to use Godot engine with C# API and testing its limits in implementing a game world.
